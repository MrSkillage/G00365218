Mobile Application Year 2 Project

Summary:
This Ionic v3 Project is an attempt to make a pokemon pokedex replica using the online database @ www.pokeapi.co 
In this project I have used what I have learned in college to do this.

User Guide:

1) On startup of the application you will be presented with a 'Login Page'.  Here you must enter in a username.  There has been a registration page made however the functionality is nonexistent.  After enterting a username and clicking the button 'login' you will be presented the next page.

2) This second page is the 'Main Page'.  Here you will see a greeting saying "Welcome ***", where *** represents your chosen username,
And a list of different pokemon.  Down the botton of the page is located a button called 'Display Pokemon Type'.  If you click that button you will be taken to the 'Pokemon Type Page'.

3) After selected a pokemon you will be brought to the final page called 'Pokemon Page'. Here you will see information on the pokemon such as their name, picture, height, weight, and type. (Functionality is limited to one pokemon being displayed).

Conclusion:
This was a fun and interesting topic to study and I will look into more in my own future.
I wish I had given this project more time.
